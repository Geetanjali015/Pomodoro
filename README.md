# Pomodoro Timer

This is an application to help you focus on any task you are working on, such as study, writing, or coding. This app is inspired by the Pomodoro Technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This is one of the projects in the Frontend Development Libraries certification program at FreeCodeCamp. This application was released to production using Github Pages. You can see a preview in this [link](https://lauraatenciob.github.io/pomodoro-timer/).
